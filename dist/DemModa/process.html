                            I originally started this project as a personal endeavor. It was supposed to be a portrait of a period when I was getting accustomed to the cafe where I work as a waiter. However, over time, I decided to turn this project into an isometric illustration. Of course, I can also create a waiter's portfolio from this work, but my main goal throughout the process was to create an isometric room reminiscent of the European Side Magazine Office.

                            As I mentioned, this cafe is an isometric illustration of the cafe where I currently work (May 2024).

                            Throughout the process, I filled my phone with cafe photos for reference. Additionally, the cafe's Instagram account and Google images were among my main reference sources.

                                The modeling process was the most challenging stage. For the work I wanted to be identical to the flowers from Zimba, I devoted the most time to modeling. Since I didn't define how detailed the work would be from the start, it was also the stage where I lost my motivation the most, but I am quite satisfied with the final result. It turned out to be very similar to its real-life counterpart. However, I can say that I intentionally added some stylized touches.

                        </div>
                        <p class="pf">
                            I can say that texturing such a detailed project was very challenging for me. Because there were so many products, I had to use many materials. However, as I aimed to maintain a certain standard, I needed to make material assignments and naming as effective as possible. At the beginning, I couldn’t decide whether to proceed based on color or model. In the end, I settled on the stack naming method. First, I did a general color blocking and then continued with polishing on this material. Whenever a different material was needed, I duplicated the material. For example:                        
                        </p>
                        <p class="pf">
                            black → black_LessRough → black_LessRough_Metal                        
                        </p>
                        <p class="pf">
                            black → black_ForMiddleTable → black_ForMiddleTable_Metallic                        
                        </p>
                        <p class="pf">
                            Even though material assignments got complicated at some points, overall, it ensured the project was completed smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pf">
                            Regarding texturing, I want to create a much more stylized version of this project and texture it more detailed and realistically using Substance 3D.
                        </p>
